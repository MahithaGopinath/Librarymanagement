        <p>Welcome to our library management system!</p>
        <p> A library management system is a software application that helps libraries and librarians automate
            and streamline their operations and services. It allows efficient management of library resources,
            such as books, journals, magazines, multimedia materials, and more.
            Library management encompasses various aspects of organizing and administering library resources and
            services effectively.
            It involves the planning, coordination, and supervision of library activities to meet the information needs
            of users and ensure smooth operations.
